Problem:

1. During a method call if the object calling a method needed to be changed, so in that case changes would be made in main class 
both left and right part of object declaration which will eventually need stopping the application.

2. To tackle this interface is created which is implemented by classes and during object declaration only right part of declaration
is changed.

3. Still we need to close the application.

Solution:

1. Dependency injection is the most apt solution for this case.

2. In dependency injection an object is injected in main class rather than creating inside main class.

3. That simply means object is created somewhere else and is used in main class.

4. So suppose many objects are made and are ready to be used in main class, with help of dependency injection, refrence variable 
will point to that object which will be used inside main class.

5. This will enable us to use various features of an application and in main these features are easily injected making sure application
is still running.


Code steps:

Main.java

ApplicationContext based configuration

First make sure to change bean defination to ApplicationContext based defination.

1. Create object of ApplicationContext context to invoke method getBean().
        ApplicationContext context=new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext();

2. getBean object invoked which have parameter "vehicle" which is either pointing to Car object or Bike object.
        Vehicle obj=(Vehicle)context.getBean("vehicle");

3. Make a application context xml file in resource folderand enter path in point 1.
        ApplicationContext context=new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("Spring.xml");

With above 3 steps now no changes need to be made in main class.

All changes will take place inside xml file.

In case when we have to give value to a property using bean make changes in xml file.

<bean id="tyre" class="com.beandemo.beandemo.Tyre">
        <property name="brand" value="CEAT - MRF"></property>
</bean>

Internally it will use set method to set the value for the property.

Annotation based configuration

1. First make sure to change bean defination to annotation based configuration.

2. Annotate the classes Car and Bike with @Component annotation.

3. In Spring.xml use this line to make sure beans are available
        <context:component-scan base-package="com.beandemo.beandemo"></context:component-scan>

4. We can inject object in another class by annotating the class as component and injecting it with help of @autowireed keyword.


AVOIDING USING XML file

1. We can avoid using xml file and instead of that make a Configurable java file.

2. To make a java file configurable use @Configurable annotation.

3. And we have to make function of class for which we need to inject object off, by using annotation @Bean.

4. In main file ApplicationContext reference variable will point to this object.
        ApplicationContext context=new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);

5. Then we will invoke getBean object.
        Samsung obj=(Samsung)context.getBean("samsung");

NOTE: Whenever an object is autowired inside a class, the bean method inside AppConfig class set the method and for this getter 
and setter are needed inside the class where object is injected.
